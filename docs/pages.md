# Pages & Routing

This project uses the Next.js App Router (`app/` directory).

## Routes

- `/` → `app/page.tsx` (Home)
- Global layout → `app/layout.tsx`

## Routing Behavior

- Files under `app/` map to routes by folder and filename.
- `layout.tsx` wraps all nested routes and provides shared UI and metadata.
- `page.tsx` defines the UI rendered for a route segment.

## Metadata

`app/layout.tsx` exports a `metadata` object typed as `Metadata` from `next`, used for document head and SEO.

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};
```

## Images

The project uses `next/image` in `app/page.tsx` for optimized images with automatic resizing and lazy loading.
